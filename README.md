# weather-dashboard

The following code is for a weather dashboard.
The page opens to a search bar, where you may type any city in the world. 
Upon hitting the search button the page will display containers with the temperature, humidity and wind speeds for not only the present day but also five days ahead in the city you have entered in.
All your searches will display underneath the search bar and if you click on those buttons the page will display the forecast once again.
Using local storage your last search will be stored on the page as well.
